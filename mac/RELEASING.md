# Releasing zshell

zshell auto-updates with [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org). Releases live in a
**Cloudflare R2** bucket served at **`https://releases.zshell.sh`**. New users
download a notarized **`.dmg`**; existing users get smaller in-app delta updates
via Sparkle, which reads the appcast at `https://releases.zshell.sh/appcast.xml`,
verifies each build's EdDSA signature, and installs it. One release command
produces both.

Run release commands from `mac/`. Once set up, cutting a release is one command:

```sh
bun scripts/release.ts        # or: bun run release
```

- Updater code: [`zshell/Updater.swift`](zshell/Updater.swift) — **Check for Updates…**
  (app menu) and the **Updates** section in Settings.
- Feed URL + public key: [`zshell/Info.plist`](zshell/Info.plist)
  (`SUFeedURL`, `SUPublicEDKey`).
- Release automation (Bun + TypeScript): [`scripts/release.ts`](scripts/release.ts),
  [`scripts/generate-appcast.ts`](scripts/generate-appcast.ts),
  [`scripts/ExportOptions.plist`](scripts/ExportOptions.plist).

## One-time setup

The release script runs on [Bun](https://bun.sh) (`brew install bun`) and builds
the disk image with [`create-dmg`](https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg)
(`brew install create-dmg`). Optionally run `bun install` once for editor
type-checking of the scripts — it isn't needed to run them.

### 1. Sparkle signing keys

Every update is signed with an ed25519 key. The **private** key stays in your
login keychain under the `zshell-update-ed25519` account; the **public** key ships
in the app.

Download the Sparkle tools (`Sparkle-<version>.tar.xz` from the
[releases page](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases)), unpack,
then:

```sh
./bin/generate_keys --account zshell-update-ed25519
```

Copy the printed public key into [`zshell/Info.plist`](zshell/Info.plist), replacing
the existing `SUPublicEDKey` value. Back the private key up somewhere safe:

```sh
./bin/generate_keys --account zshell-update-ed25519 -x sparkle_private_key.txt   # export → password manager
./bin/generate_keys --account zshell-update-ed25519 -f sparkle_private_key.txt   # import on another machine / CI
```

> ⚠️ Lose the private key and you can't ship updates to existing users. Keep it.

Put the Sparkle `bin/` on your `PATH`, or point the release at it with
`SPARKLE_BIN=/path/to/Sparkle/bin`.

### 2. Developer ID signing + notarization

Sparkle needs the app signed with your **Developer ID** and **notarized**
(Gatekeeper blocks un-notarized apps; Hardened Runtime is already enabled in the
project).

- Install your **Developer ID Application** certificate in the login keychain.
  The script signs the `.dmg` with it too; if you have more than one such cert,
  set `SIGN_IDENTITY` to the exact name or SHA-1.
- Set `teamID` in [`scripts/ExportOptions.plist`](scripts/ExportOptions.plist)
  (find it with `xcrun security find-identity -v -p codesigning`).
- Store notarization credentials once as a keychain profile named `NOTARY`:
  ```sh
  xcrun notarytool store-credentials NOTARY \
    --apple-id you@example.com --team-id XXXXXXXXXX
  # (paste an app-specific password, or use --key for an App Store Connect API key)
  ```

### 3. Cloudflare R2 bucket + domain

1. Create an R2 bucket (default name the script expects: `zshell-releases` — or set
   `R2_BUCKET`).
2. Attach the custom domain **`releases.zshell.sh`** to the bucket
   (R2 → your bucket → Settings → Custom Domains). This serves objects publicly
   at `https://releases.zshell.sh/<file>`.
3. Create an **R2 API token** (R2 → Manage API Tokens → Object Read & Write).
   It only needs access to this one bucket — the script passes
   `--s3-no-check-bucket`, so no bucket-creation permission is required.

### 4. rclone remote for R2

The script uses [rclone](https://rclone.org) to sync the bucket
(`brew install rclone`). Add an R2 remote named `r2` — either run
`rclone config` (type **S3**, provider **Cloudflare**), or drop this into
`~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`:

```ini
[r2]
type = s3
provider = Cloudflare
access_key_id = <R2 access key id>
secret_access_key = <R2 secret access key>
endpoint = https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
region = auto
no_check_bucket = true
```

`no_check_bucket = true` stops rclone from trying to create the (already
existing) bucket — needed for bucket-scoped tokens. The script also passes
`--s3-no-check-bucket`, so this line is belt-and-suspenders.

Verify with `rclone lsf r2:zshell-releases --s3-no-check-bucket`.

## Cutting a release

1. **Bump the version** in the `zshell` target's build settings:
   - `MARKETING_VERSION` — user-visible, e.g. `1.1` (`CFBundleShortVersionString`).
   - `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` — build number, e.g. `2` (`CFBundleVersion`).
     **Must increase every release** — Sparkle compares it to decide what's newer.
2. **Write the release notes** — add a `## [1.1]` section at the top of
   [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) (the heading must match `MARKETING_VERSION`).
3. **Run it:**
   ```sh
   bun scripts/release.ts        # or: bun run release
   ```

That's it. The script archives → exports a Developer ID app → builds a
notarized, stapled **`.dmg`** → staples the app and zips it for Sparkle →
attaches the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as release notes → pulls the 15
most recent archives from R2 by default (so Sparkle can build deltas) →
regenerates `appcast.xml` → uploads the DMG and the update archives to R2. When
it finishes:

- **Download link** (for the website): `https://releases.zshell.sh/zshell-<version>.dmg`
- **In-app updates**: served from the same origin via the appcast.

Notarizing the DMG also notarizes the app's code, so the script staples both from
a single submission — the DMG for direct downloads, the app for the Sparkle zip.

Finally it bumps the **Homebrew cask** and redeploys the **website** (both
below).

Test by running an **older** build and choosing **Check for Updates…**.

### Options

| Env | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SPARKLE_KEY_ACCOUNT` | `zshell-update-ed25519` | keychain account holding the private EdDSA key |
| `R2_BUCKET` | `zshell-releases` | R2 bucket name |
| `R2_REMOTE` | `r2` | rclone remote name |
| `NOTARY_PROFILE` | `NOTARY` | `notarytool` keychain profile |
| `SIGN_IDENTITY` | `Developer ID Application` | codesigning identity for the DMG |
| `EXPORT_OPTIONS` | `scripts/ExportOptions.plist` | export config |
| `DOWNLOAD_URL_PREFIX` | `https://releases.zshell.sh/` | base URL in the appcast |
| `HISTORY_COUNT` | `15` | number of recent archives to pull for delta generation |
| `BUILD_JOBS` | half of logical CPUs (min 1) | max concurrent `xcodebuild` tasks during archive (limits parallel `swift-frontend` work) |
| `BUILD_NICE=1` | — | archive under utility QoS (`taskpolicy`) so interactive work keeps priority |
| `TAP_REPO` | `wzz6423/homebrew-tap` | tap holding the Homebrew cask |
| `TAP_CASK` | `Casks/zshell.rb` | cask path within the tap |
| `TAP_DIR` | `build/homebrew-tap` | local checkout of the tap |
| `FORCE=1` | — | re-release a version that already exists |
| `NO_TAP=1` | — | skip bumping the Homebrew cask |
| `SITE_WORKFLOW` | `Web Pages` | workflow that rebuilds the website |
| `SITE_BRANCH` | `main` | branch that workflow deploys |
| `NO_SITE=1` | — | skip redeploying the website |
| `NO_HISTORY=1` | — | skip pulling old archives (full updates, no deltas) |

Release builds use whole-module Swift optimization, so a single `swift-frontend`
can still use multiple cores even with a low `BUILD_JOBS`. Use `BUILD_JOBS=2`
(and optionally `BUILD_NICE=1`) if the archive step makes the machine lag.

## The Homebrew cask

zshell is also installable with `brew install wzz6423/tap/zshell`, from the
cask at [`wzz6423/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/wzz6423/homebrew-tap)
(`Casks/zshell.rb`). The tap is shared with other projects, so the release script
refreshes the repository's default branch and changes only this cask. If the file
does not exist yet, the first release creates it without touching the other
recipes. The cask downloads the same `.dmg` from R2, so it needs the new version
and its `sha256` after every release.

`scripts/release.ts` does that for you as its last step
([`scripts/bump-cask.ts`](scripts/bump-cask.ts)): it hashes the DMG it just
built, clones/refreshes the tap under `build/homebrew-tap`, rewrites the
`version` and `sha256` stanzas, and pushes a `zshell <version>` commit. It needs
**push access to the tap over SSH** — nothing else.

The bump runs *after* the upload, so the hash always covers a DMG that's already
fetchable, and a failure there is a warning rather than a failed release — the
release is live either way. Retry it on its own:

```sh
bun scripts/bump-cask.ts 1.1     # downloads the published DMG if it's not in build/
```

Re-running when the cask already names that version is a no-op. Set `NO_TAP=1`
to skip the bump entirely.

The cask marks `auto_updates true`; the app therefore invokes
`brew upgrade --cask --greedy-auto-updates zshell` for Homebrew installs. Its
`depends_on macos:` mirrors the app's `LSMinimumSystemVersion`, which
the bump doesn't touch — it only warns when the two drift apart. If you raise the
deployment target, edit that stanza in the tap by hand.

---

## The website

[zshell.sh](https://zshell.sh) is a static site on GitHub Pages, prerendered by
the `Web Pages` workflow. Its download buttons read the version, the minimum
system, and the DMG URL out of the appcast **while it is being prerendered** —
there is no server to ask at request time, so the site keeps advertising the
release it was last built against.

`scripts/release.ts` therefore dispatches that workflow as its final step, after
the appcast is up:

```sh
gh workflow run "Web Pages" --ref main
```

It needs the `gh` CLI, logged in with access to this repository. Like the cask
bump this runs after the release is live, so a failure is a warning with that
command to retry, and `NO_SITE=1` skips it. A push to `main` that touches `web/`
deploys the site too — the dispatch exists for releases, which change nothing in
the repository.

## Notes

- **Two artifacts per release:** a notarized `.dmg` (what people download) and a
  `.zip` (what Sparkle installs, with binary deltas). Only the `.zip` goes in the
  appcast; point your website's download button at
  `https://releases.zshell.sh/zshell-<version>.dmg`. Want a stable URL? Add a
  Cloudflare redirect from e.g. `/download` to the newest `.dmg`.
- **Automatic checks:** by default Sparkle asks the user once whether to allow
  automatic update checks. To opt in by default (no prompt), add to
  [`zshell/Info.plist`](zshell/Info.plist):
  ```xml
  <key>SUEnableAutomaticChecks</key>
  <true/>
  ```
  The **Updates** settings toggle lets users change it either way.
- **Release notes** live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md). The release script
  publishes the matching version section as `zshell-<version>.md` next to the
  archive, and `generate_appcast` links it as the update's release notes
  (Sparkle 2.9+ renders Markdown). No matching section → the release just ships
  without notes. Notes for older versions stay in R2, so they keep showing.
- `SUPublicEDKey` must match the private key used to sign the appcast. A mismatch
  lets the app check the feed but makes update installation fail signature verification.
- zshell isn't sandboxed, so no Sparkle XPC services need bundling.
- Old archives stay in R2 so users far behind can still download them. Only the
  recent archives needed for new deltas are staged under `build/`, which is
  git-ignored.
