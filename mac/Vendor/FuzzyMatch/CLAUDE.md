# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FuzzyMatcher is a high-performance fuzzy string matching library for Swift. It provides two matching modes — **Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance** (default, penalty-driven) and **Smith-Waterman local alignment** (bonus-driven) — both with multi-stage prefiltering and zero-allocation hot paths.

**Requirements:** Swift 6.0+, macOS 14+

> **Note:** When the project moves up to require Swift 6.2, run the `Agents/SPANS_MIGRATION.md` migration guide to restore Span usage for improved memory safety.

## Build Commands

```bash
swift build                    # Debug build
swift build -c release         # Release build
swift test                     # Run all tests

swift package --package-path Benchmarks benchmark  # Run benchmarks (builds release first)
```

## Architecture

### Matching Modes

The library supports two matching algorithms selected via `MatchConfig.algorithm`:

- **Edit Distance** (default) — Penalty-driven scoring using Damerau-Levenshtein. Multi-phase pipeline: exact → prefix → substring → subsequence → acronym. Best for typo tolerance, prefix-aware search, and short queries.
- **Smith-Waterman** — Bonus-driven local alignment (similar to nucleo/fzf). Single DP pass + acronym fallback. Best for multi-word queries, high throughput, and code/file search.

Both modes share the same API surface, zero-allocation hot path, and `score(_:against:buffer:)` entry point. See `Documentation/MATCHING_MODES.md` for a detailed comparison.

### Core Components

The library follows a pipeline architecture:

1. **Query Preparation** (`FuzzyQuery.swift`) - Precomputes lowercased form, character bitmask, trigrams, and `containsSpaces` flag for the query
2. **Prefiltering & Normalization** (`Prefilters.swift`) - Three-stage fast rejection: length bounds (O(1)), 37-bit character bitmask (O(1)), trigram similarity (O(n)). Also contains `lowercaseUTF8()` which performs case folding, diacritic normalization (Latin-1 → ASCII), and confusable-character normalization (curly quotes → `'`, en-dash → `-`, NBSP → space, etc.)
3. **Edit Distance** (`EditDistance.swift`) - Damerau-Levenshtein with prefix and substring variants using rolling array optimization
4. **Smith-Waterman** (`SmithWaterman.swift`, `FuzzyMatcher+SmithWaterman.swift`) - Local alignment DP with tiered boundary bonuses, multi-word atom splitting, and integer arithmetic. Mirrors the normalization from Prefilters.swift in its merged lowercase+bonus pass
5. **Scoring** (`ScoringBonuses.swift`, `WordBoundary.swift`) - Position-based bonuses for word boundaries, consecutive matches, and gap penalties (edit distance mode)
6. **Acronym Matching** (`FuzzyMatcher.swift`) - Word-initial character matching for abbreviations (e.g., "bms" → "Bristol-Myers Squibb") — used by both modes
7. **Highlight Ranges** (`Highlighting/FuzzyMatcher+Highlight.swift`, `Highlighting/EditDistancePositions.swift`, `Highlighting/SmithWatermanPositions.swift`) - Returns `[Range<String.Index>]` of matched character positions for UI highlighting. Separate from the scoring hot path — called only for visible results. Uses full-matrix DP traceback variants of both ED and SW algorithms to recover alignment positions
8. **Result** (`ScoredMatch.swift`, `MatchKind.swift`) - Final score (0.0-1.0) with match type (exact/prefix/substring/acronym)

### Highlight / Scoring Separation

The `Highlighting/` subdirectory contains full-matrix DP traceback variants of both algorithms, kept deliberately separate from the scoring hot path. **Never modify the main scoring code paths (`EditDistance.swift`, `SmithWaterman.swift`, `FuzzyMatcher+SmithWaterman.swift`) to accommodate highlight functionality** — the scoring path is optimized for zero-allocation throughput and must stay independent. When changing the core algorithm logic (DP recurrences, bonus calculations, normalization), the corresponding highlight traceback code in `Highlighting/` must be updated to match, otherwise score and highlight results will diverge.

### Key Design Patterns

- **Zero-allocation hot path**: `ScoringBuffer` provides reusable arrays for the score() method
- **Thread safety**: All types are `Sendable`; each thread uses its own buffer
- **UTF-8 processing**: Direct byte operations via `withContiguousStorageIfAvailable` for performance
- **Prepare-once pattern**: Query preparation is separate from scoring for repeated use

### Main Entry Point

`FuzzyMatcher.swift` orchestrates the edit distance scoring pipeline via decomposed phase methods (`checkExactMatch`, `scorePrefix`, `scoreSubstring`, `scoreSubsequence`, `scoreAcronym`) coordinated through a `ScoringState` struct. `FuzzyMatcher+SmithWaterman.swift` handles Smith-Waterman scoring with a single DP pass and optional atom splitting. `Highlighting/FuzzyMatcher+Highlight.swift` provides the `highlight(_:against:)` method that returns matched character ranges for UI display — it dispatches by algorithm mode and uses full-matrix DP traceback variants (`Highlighting/EditDistancePositions.swift`, `Highlighting/SmithWatermanPositions.swift`) separate from the scoring hot path. `FuzzyMatcher+Convenience.swift` provides convenience wrappers. The `score(_:against:buffer:)` method dispatches to the appropriate implementation based on `MatchConfig.algorithm`.

**UTF-8 API** (highest throughput — enables cross-module inlining):
```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
let query = matcher.prepare("searchTerm")
var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()
var candidate = "someCandidate"
candidate.withUTF8 { utf8 in
    if let match = matcher.score(utf8: utf8, against: query, buffer: &buffer) { ... }
}
```

> **Note:** On Swift 6.0, `String.withUTF8` is non-inlinable, preventing cross-module optimization for the String API. The `score(utf8:against:buffer:)` method is `@inlinable` and bypasses this limitation, delivering ~60% higher throughput. This gap will be resolved when the library adopts Swift 6.2+ Span.

**String API** (zero allocations — high performance for callers with String inputs):
```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
let query = matcher.prepare("searchTerm")
var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()
if let match = matcher.score(candidate, against: query, buffer: &buffer) { ... }
```

**Convenience API** (allocates internally — use for quick use or small sets):
```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
if let match = matcher.score("candidate", against: "search") { ... }
let top5 = matcher.topMatches(candidates, against: query, limit: 5)
let all = matcher.matches(candidates, against: query)
```

### Configuration

`MatchConfig.swift` selects the matching algorithm and contains shared + mode-specific parameters:

**Shared:** `minScore` (default: 0.3)

**Edit Distance** (`EditDistanceConfig`):
- `maxEditDistance` (2), `longQueryMaxEditDistance` (3), `longQueryThreshold` (13)
- `prefixWeight` (1.5), `substringWeight` (1.0), `acronymWeight` (1.0)
- `wordBoundaryBonus` (0.1), `consecutiveBonus` (0.05)
- `gapPenalty` (`.affine(open: 0.03, extend: 0.005)`)
- `firstMatchBonus` (0.15), `firstMatchBonusRange` (10), `lengthPenalty` (0.003)

**Smith-Waterman** (`SmithWatermanConfig`):
- `scoreMatch` (16), `penaltyGapStart` (3), `penaltyGapExtend` (1)
- `bonusConsecutive` (4), `bonusBoundary` (8), `bonusBoundaryWhitespace` (10), `bonusBoundaryDelimiter` (9), `bonusCamelCase` (5)
- `bonusFirstCharMultiplier` (2), `splitSpaces` (true)

## Validation

Always validate changes before committing, or earlier when complexity warrants it. Validation means running both the test suite and SwiftLint — the codebase must stay clean on both:

```bash
swift test && swiftlint lint
```

## Testing

Tests use Swift Testing framework (`@Test` macro, `#expect()` assertions). Test files mirror source structure:
- `EditDistanceTests.swift` - Core edit distance algorithm tests
- `SmithWatermanTests.swift` - Smith-Waterman alignment and scoring tests
- `PrefilterTests.swift` / `TrigramTests.swift` - Fast rejection tests
- `ScoringBonusTests.swift` / `WordBoundaryTests.swift` - Ranking tests (edit distance mode)
- `AcronymMatchTests.swift` - Word-initial abbreviation matching tests
- `HighlightTests.swift` - Highlight range extraction for UI display
- `EdgeCaseTests.swift` - Boundary conditions

## Performance

**Always benchmark before and after any performance-related change.** Do not speculatively optimize without measuring.

For **iterative performance work**, use the comparison benchmark suite against nucleo (Rust) — this gives realistic per-category timings against a real competitor on the full 271K instrument corpus:

```bash
bash Comparison/run-benchmarks.sh --fm-ed --nucleo  # Quick: FuzzyMatch(ED) vs nucleo only
bash Comparison/run-benchmarks.sh                # Full: all matchers
```

The Swift Package Benchmarks (`swift package --package-path Benchmarks benchmark`) measure micro-benchmarks and concurrency scenarios, but the comparison suite is the primary tool for evaluating real-world performance during development.

Compare results before and after your change. If a "performance optimization" shows no improvement or causes a regression, roll it back.

When updating tables in `Documentation/COMPARISON.md`, always re-run both scripts and update from their output:

```bash
bash Comparison/run-benchmarks.sh   # Performance comparison (nucleo, RapidFuzz, FuzzyMatch)
python3 Comparison/run-quality.py   # Quality comparison (FuzzyMatcher, nucleo, RapidFuzz, fzf)
```

Update the hardware/OS info block in `Documentation/COMPARISON.md` each time. Take numbers directly from script output — do not hand-edit the tables.

## Comparison Suite Prerequisites

Running the comparison benchmarks and quality scripts (`Comparison/run-benchmarks.sh`, `Comparison/run-quality.py`) requires:

- **Rust** (for nucleo benchmarks): `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- **rapidfuzz-cpp** (for RapidFuzz benchmarks): `brew install rapidfuzz-cpp`
- **fzf** (for quality comparison): `brew install fzf`

## Fuzzing

The `Fuzz/` directory contains a libFuzzer-based fuzz target that validates invariants (score range, self-match, buffer reuse, etc.) over random inputs. **Linux only** — Swift's `-sanitize=fuzzer` requires the open-source toolchain, not Xcode.

```bash
bash Fuzz/run.sh              # build only
bash Fuzz/run.sh run          # build + run (Ctrl-C to stop)
bash Fuzz/run.sh run -max_total_time=300  # run for 5 minutes
```

## Adding Test Queries

See [Agents/ADDING_TEST_QUERIES.md](Agents/ADDING_TEST_QUERIES.md) for the full query format, ground truth rules, and category definitions. Read that file when adding queries to `Resources/queries.tsv`.

## Documentation

- `Documentation/DAMERAU_LEVENSHTEIN.md` - Detailed Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm documentation with pseudocode and complexity analysis
- `Documentation/SMITH_WATERMAN.md` - Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm documentation
- `Documentation/MATCHING_MODES.md` - High-level comparison of both matching modes

## Low-Level Optimization with `@_assemblyVision`

See [Agents/ASSEMBLY_VISION.md](Agents/ASSEMBLY_VISION.md) for how to use Swift's `@_assemblyVision` attribute to inspect compiler optimization decisions (inlining, ARC traffic, bounds checks, specialization) in hot path functions. Use this when investigating low-level performance — annotate one function at a time, clean-build in release mode, and analyze the remarks.

## Prepare Release

See [Agents/PREPARE_RELEASE.md](Agents/PREPARE_RELEASE.md) for the full release preparation workflow (benchmarks, quality runs, documentation review, fuzzygrep benchmarks). Read that file when asked to "prepare release".

## Agent Usage

Always use subagents (the Task tool) when possible and beneficial. Prefer launching parallel subagents for independent work such as:
- Exploring multiple files or directories simultaneously
- Running research queries that don't depend on each other
- Investigating separate parts of the codebase in parallel

This maximizes throughput and keeps the main context window focused.
