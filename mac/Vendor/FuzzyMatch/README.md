FuzzyMatch was developed for searching financial instrument databases — stock tickers, fund names, ISINs — where typo tolerance, prefix-aware ranking, and sub-millisecond latency matter. The same qualities make it well suited to any domain with a large, heterogeneous candidate set: code identifiers, file names, product catalogs, contact lists, or anything else a user might search with imprecise input.

Full [API documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/ordo-one/FuzzyMatch/documentation) is available on the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com).

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add FuzzyMatch to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ordo-one/FuzzyMatch.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then add it to your target dependencies:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: ["FuzzyMatch"]
)
```

## Quick Start

```swift
import FuzzyMatch

let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()

// One-shot scoring — simplest API
if let match = matcher.score("getUserById", against: "getUser") {
    print("score=\(match.score), kind=\(match.kind)")
}

// Top-N matching — returns sorted results
let query = matcher.prepare("config")
let top3 = matcher.topMatches(
    ["appConfig", "configManager", "database", "userConfig"],
    against: query,
    limit: 3
)
for result in top3 {
    print("\(result.candidate): \(result.match.score)")
}
```

## Try It — Interactive Search App

The `Examples/FuzzySearch/` directory contains a macOS app for exploring how FuzzyMatch works interactively. It loads a 271K financial instrument corpus and live-searches as you type, showing the top results with highlighted matched characters. Switch between Edit Distance and Smith-Waterman algorithms to see how they rank differently, tweak all algorithm parameters in the inspector panel and see results update live, or use File > Open (Cmd+O) to load your own newline-delimited data.

Open the Xcode project and hit Run:

```bash
open Examples/FuzzySearch/FuzzySearch.xcodeproj
```

## Usage

### Convenience API

For quick exploration, prototyping, or when scoring a small number of candidates:

```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()

// One-shot: prepare + score in a single call
if let match = matcher.score("getUserById", against: "usr") {
    print("Score: \(match.score)")
}

// Top-N: returns the best matches sorted by score
let query = matcher.prepare("config")
let top5 = matcher.topMatches(candidates, against: query, limit: 5)

// All matches: returns every match sorted by score
let all = matcher.matches(candidates, against: query)
```

> **Note:** Convenience methods allocate a new buffer per call. For high-throughput
> or latency-sensitive use, see **High-Performance API** below.

### High-Performance API (Zero-Allocation Hot Path)

For scoring many candidates against the same query — the recommended path for production use, interactive search, and batch processing:

```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()

// 1. Prepare the query once (precomputes bitmask, trigrams, etc.)
let query = matcher.prepare("getUser")

// 2. Create a reusable buffer (eliminates allocations in the scoring loop)
var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()

// 3. Score candidates — zero heap allocations per call
let candidates = ["getUserById", "getUsername", "setUser", "fetchData"]
for candidate in candidates {
    if let match = matcher.score(candidate, against: query, buffer: &buffer) {
        print("\(candidate): score=\(match.score), kind=\(match.kind)")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
getUserById: score=0.9988, kind=prefix
getUsername: score=0.9988, kind=prefix
setUser: score=0.9047619047619048, kind=prefix
```

### UTF-8 API (Maximum Throughput)

For the highest possible throughput, use `score(utf8:against:buffer:)` with pre-extracted UTF-8 bytes. This `@inlinable` method enables cross-module inlining that the String overload cannot achieve on Swift 6.0 (where `String.withUTF8` is non-inlinable), delivering 50-100% higher throughput depending on the algorithm:

```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
let query = matcher.prepare("getUser")
var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()

for var candidate in candidates {
    candidate.withUTF8 { utf8 in
        if let match = matcher.score(utf8: utf8, against: query, buffer: &buffer) {
            print("score=\(match.score)")
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** This performance gap is a Swift 6.0 limitation. When the library adopts Swift 6.2+ Span, the String API will recover full throughput and this method may be deprecated.

### Custom Configuration

```swift
// Edit distance mode with custom tuning
let config = MatchConfig(
    minScore: 0.5,
    algorithm: .editDistance(EditDistanceConfig(
        maxEditDistance: 3,        // Allow up to 3 edits (default: 2)
        prefixWeight: 2.0,        // Boost prefix matches (default: 1.5)
        substringWeight: 0.8,     // Weight for substring matches (default: 1.0)
        wordBoundaryBonus: 0.12,  // Bonus for word boundary matches (default: 0.1)
        consecutiveBonus: 0.06,   // Bonus for consecutive matches (default: 0.05)
        gapPenalty: .affine(open: 0.04, extend: 0.01)  // Gap penalty model
    ))
)
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher(config: config)

// Smith-Waterman mode with custom tuning
let swConfig = MatchConfig(
    algorithm: .smithWaterman(SmithWatermanConfig(
        penaltyGapStart: 5,
        bonusBoundary: 10,
        bonusCamelCase: 7
    ))
)
let swMatcher = FuzzyMatcher(config: swConfig)
```

### Scoring Bonuses

FuzzyMatcher uses intelligent scoring bonuses to improve ranking quality:

- **Word Boundary Bonus**: Matches at camelCase transitions (`getUserById`), snake_case boundaries (`get_user`), and after digits receive a bonus
- **Consecutive Bonus**: Characters that match consecutively in the candidate receive a bonus
- **Gap Penalty**: Gaps between matched characters incur a penalty. Two models available:
  - `.affine(open:extend:)` (default) - Starting a gap costs more than continuing one
  - `.linear(perCharacter:)` - Each gap character costs the same
- **First Match Bonus**: Matches starting early in the candidate receive a bonus that decays with position

This means queries like "gubi" will rank "getUserById" higher than "debugging" because the query characters match at word boundaries.

```swift
// Disable bonuses for pure edit-distance scoring
let noBonusConfig = MatchConfig(
    algorithm: .editDistance(EditDistanceConfig(
        wordBoundaryBonus: 0.0,
        consecutiveBonus: 0.0,
        gapPenalty: .none,
        firstMatchBonus: 0.0
    ))
)

// Use linear gap penalty instead of affine
let linearConfig = MatchConfig(
    algorithm: .editDistance(EditDistanceConfig(
        gapPenalty: .linear(perCharacter: 0.01)
    ))
)
```

### Concurrent Usage

FuzzyMatcher is fully thread-safe. Each task should use its own buffer:

```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
let query = matcher.prepare("getData")
let candidates = loadLargeCandidateList()

// Process concurrently using Swift TaskGroup
let workerCount = 8
let chunkSize = (candidates.count + workerCount - 1) / workerCount

await withTaskGroup(of: [ScoredMatch].self) { group in
    for start in stride(from: 0, to: candidates.count, by: chunkSize) {
        let end = min(start + chunkSize, candidates.count)
        let chunk = candidates[start..<end]
        group.addTask {
            var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()  // Each task gets its own buffer
            return chunk.compactMap { candidate in
                matcher.score(candidate, against: query, buffer: &buffer)
            }
        }
    }

    // Collect results from all tasks
    for await taskMatches in group {
        // Handle matches...
    }
}
```

### Highlighting Matched Characters

After scoring, use `attributedHighlight()` to get a styled `AttributedString` for UI display. Call it only for visible results (typically ~10-20), not the full corpus:

```swift
import FuzzyMatch
import SwiftUI  // or just Foundation on Linux

let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
let query = matcher.prepare("mod")

// Returns nil if no match — styled AttributedString otherwise
if let text = matcher.attributedHighlight("format:modern", against: query, applying: {
    $0.foregroundColor = .orange  // SwiftUI attribute
}) {
    // text has "mod" styled in orange, rest unstyled
}
```

On Linux or without SwiftUI, use Foundation-level attributes:

```swift
if let text = matcher.attributedHighlight("format:modern", against: query, applying: {
    $0.inlinePresentationIntent = .stronglyEmphasized  // bold
}) {
    // text has "mod" in bold
}
```

For full control over the raw ranges, use `highlight()` directly:

```swift
if let ranges = matcher.highlight("format:modern", against: query) {
    // ranges: [Range<String.Index>] — coalesced and sorted
    var text = AttributedString("format:modern")
    for range in ranges {
        let start = AttributedString.Index(range.lowerBound, within: text)!
        let end = AttributedString.Index(range.upperBound, within: text)!
        text[start..<end].foregroundColor = .accentColor
    }
}
```

The returned ranges are coalesced (adjacent matches merged) and sorted. Highlights work with both matching modes and handle:

- **Exact matches** — single range covering the full string
- **Subsequence matches** — scattered ranges at matched positions (e.g., `["g", "U", "B", "I"]` for "gubi" in "getUserById")
- **Acronym matches** — word-initial positions (e.g., `["B", "M", "S"]` for "bms" in "Bristol-Myers Squibb")
- **Unicode normalization** — diacritics (`"café"` highlighted for query `"cafe"`), combining marks, and confusable characters

**Typo-tolerant highlighting (edit distance mode):** When a query contains typos, the highlight shows which candidate characters participated in the alignment — including substituted positions:

```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()

// Typo: 'a' instead of 'e' — highlights "getUser" (substituted 'e' included)
matcher.highlight("getUserById", against: "getusar")   // → ["getUser"]

// Missing character — highlights around the gap
matcher.highlight("format:modern", against: "modrn")   // → ["mod", "rn"]

// Doubled character — extra char absorbed, highlights normally
matcher.highlight("getUserById", against: "geetuser")  // → ["getUser"]

// Transposed characters — both positions highlighted
matcher.highlight("getUserById", against: "gteuser")   // → ["getUser"]
```

**Smith-Waterman highlighting** uses the same API but runs the SW alignment DP with traceback instead. Multi-word queries highlight each atom independently:

```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher(config: .smithWaterman)

// Multi-word: both atoms highlighted
matcher.highlight("fooXXXbar", against: "foo bar")     // → ["foo", "bar"]
```

> **Performance:** `highlight()` is more expensive than `score()` — it allocates internally and runs a full-matrix DP traceback. Typical cost per call on short candidates (~8-30 characters): ~1.2 μs (ED), ~0.8 μs (SW). Highlighting 20 visible results takes ~24 μs (ED) or ~16 μs (SW).

### Filtering and Sorting Results

Using the convenience API:

```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
let query = matcher.prepare("config")

// Get all matches sorted by score (highest first)
let sorted = matcher.matches(
    ["configuration", "ConfigManager", "user_config", "settings"],
    against: query
)
for result in sorted {
    print("\(result.candidate): \(result.match.score)")
}
```

Or using the high-performance API for zero-allocation control:

```swift
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
let query = matcher.prepare("config")
var buffer = matcher.makeBuffer()

let candidates = ["configuration", "ConfigManager", "user_config", "settings"]

let results = candidates.compactMap { candidate -> (String, ScoredMatch)? in
    guard let match = matcher.score(candidate, against: query, buffer: &buffer) else {
        return nil
    }
    return (candidate, match)
}

let sorted = results.sorted { $0.1.score > $1.1.score }
for (candidate, match) in sorted {
    print("\(candidate): \(match.score)")
}
```

## Match Kinds

FuzzyMatcher distinguishes between five types of matches:

| Kind | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `.exact` | Query exactly equals candidate (case-insensitive) | "user" matches "User" |
| `.prefix` | Query matches the beginning of candidate | "get" matches "getUserById" |
| `.substring` | Query matches somewhere within candidate | "user" matches "getCurrentUser" |
| `.acronym` | Query matches word-initial characters | "bms" matches "Bristol-Myers Squibb" |
| `.alignment` | Query matched via Smith-Waterman local alignment | "gubi" matches "getUserById" |

In edit distance mode, prefix matches receive a configurable bonus (`prefixWeight`), and acronym matches use `acronymWeight`. In Smith-Waterman mode, all non-exact, non-acronym matches return as `.alignment`.

## Quality

Tested against [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [nucleo](https://github.com/helix-editor/nucleo), and [RapidFuzz](https://github.com/rapidfuzz/rapidfuzz-cpp) on a 272K financial instruments corpus (197 queries across 9 categories):

| Metric | FuzzyMatch (ED) | FuzzyMatch (SW) | nucleo | fzf |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------|-----|
| Hit rate | **197/197** | 187/197 | 190/197 | 186/197 |
| Top-1 agreement with fzf | **65%** (128/197) | 42% | 44% | — |
| Typo handling | Best | None | Decent | None |
| Abbreviations (e.g., "bms" → Bristol-Myers Squibb) | **7/12** | **7/12** | 2/12 | 2/12 |

FuzzyMatch (ED) agrees with fzf on all exact symbol, ISIN, symbol-with-spaces, and most prefix and substring queries. Its Damerau-Levenshtein foundation handles typos that fzf and nucleo miss entirely ("Voeing", "Gokdman Sachs"), and its acronym matching pass significantly outperforms all other matchers on abbreviation queries.

See [COMPARISON.md](Documentation/COMPARISON.md) for detailed results, per-category breakdowns, and top-3 analysis.

### Smith-Waterman Mode Quality

In Smith-Waterman mode, FuzzyMatch trades typo tolerance for higher throughput and nucleo-compatible rankings:

| Metric | FuzzyMatch (ED) | FuzzyMatch (SW) | nucleo |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Hit rate | **197/197** | 187/197 | 190/197 |
| Top-1 agreement with nucleo | 77/197 | **182/197** | — |
| Throughput | 33M/sec | 66M/sec | 97M/sec |

FuzzyMatch (SW) agrees with nucleo on 92% of top-1 rankings (182/197), making it a drop-in replacement for nucleo-style matching in pure Swift with no FFI overhead. The 10 missing queries are typo-heavy inputs that require edit distance to resolve.

## Performance

### Prefiltering Pipeline

FuzzyMatcher uses a three-stage prefiltering pipeline to quickly reject non-matching candidates before computing expensive edit distance:

1. **Length Bounds** - Rejects candidates that are too short (no upper limit to support subsequence matching)
2. **Character Bitmask** - 64-bit bloom filter checks that the number of distinct missing character types is within an adaptive tolerance (`popcount(queryMask & ~candidateMask) <= bitmaskTolerance`). The tolerance is strict (0) for very short queries (≤3 chars) — blocking substitution typos but still allowing transpositions (same character set) — and equals `effectiveMaxEditDistance` for longer ones, allowing substitution typos while still quickly rejecting candidates that are too different.
3. **Trigrams** - Verifies shared 3-character sequences

### Benchmarks

Run benchmarks with:

```bash
swift package --package-path Benchmarks benchmark
```

Typical performance on Apple Silicon (M4 Max):

| Scenario | Time |
|----------|------|
| Query preparation | ~2.2μs |
| 1M dataset (single-threaded) | ~36ms |
| 1M dataset (8 workers) | ~4.8ms |
| 1M dataset (16 workers) | ~3.8ms |

### Comparison Throughput

On a 272K candidate corpus (M4 Max), FuzzyMatcher processes ~33M candidates/sec in edit distance mode and ~66M candidates/sec in Smith-Waterman mode — both comfortably interactive. nucleo (Rust) is faster at ~97M/sec but uses a different language runtime. Perhaps surprisingly, FuzzyMatch is also significantly faster than a naive `lowercased().contains()` baseline (~3M candidates/sec) — fuzzy matching with prefiltering can outperform brute-force substring search while delivering far better results for real-world user input. See [COMPARISON.md](Documentation/COMPARISON.md) for full performance comparison.

### Zero-Allocation Scoring

The hot path (`score` method) performs zero heap allocations when using prepared queries and reusable buffers. This is critical for responsive UI and high-throughput batch processing.

### fuzzygrep

The `Examples/` directory includes `fuzzygrep`, a parallel grep-like tool built on FuzzyMatch. It reads stdin, distributes lines round-robin across all available cores, and writes ordered results to stdout.

```bash
fuzzygrep color -score 0.99 < /usr/share/dict/words
```

Measured on Apple Silicon (M4 Max, 16 cores), release build, query `1235321 -score 0.5` against lines of the form "line NNNNN", reading from a pre-generated file to eliminate I/O bottlenecks:

**Edit Distance mode:**

| Input size | Wall time | CPU time | CPU utilization |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| 10M lines | 0.25s | 2.0s | ~800% |
| 100M lines | 2.5s | 22s | ~890% |

**Smith-Waterman mode:**

| Input size | Wall time | CPU time | CPU utilization |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| 10M lines | 0.29s | 1.0s | ~350% |
| 100M lines | 3.7s | 24s | ~640% |

Wall times are I/O-bound (single-threaded stdin reader); both modes achieve ~40M lines/sec throughput. At 10M lines, Smith-Waterman's ~2x lower per-line matching cost is visible in CPU time; at 100M lines, thread coordination and memory pressure dominate.

## Fuzz Testing

FuzzyMatcher includes a [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)-based fuzz target that validates scoring invariants over randomized inputs. The fuzzer generates arbitrary (query, candidate, config) combinations and checks that key properties always hold.

> **Linux only** — Swift's `-sanitize=fuzzer` requires the open-source Swift toolchain. It is not available in the Xcode toolchain on macOS.

**Requirements:** Swift 6.0+ open-source toolchain on Linux.

```bash
# Build only (release)
bash Fuzz/run.sh

# Build and run (Ctrl-C to stop)
bash Fuzz/run.sh run

# Run for 60 seconds
bash Fuzz/run.sh run -max_total_time=60

# Debug build for lldb
bash Fuzz/run.sh debug run
```

The fuzz target cycles through ten `MatchConfig` variants — five edit distance (default, exact-only, strict, lenient, picker-style) and five Smith-Waterman (default, lenient, strict, high gap penalty, no space splitting) — and validates five invariants on every input:

1. **No crash** — scoring never panics or traps
2. **Score range** — results are in [0.0, 1.0] and >= `minScore`
3. **Self-match** — every non-empty string scores 1.0 against itself with `.exact` kind
4. **Empty query** — empty queries always match with score 1.0
5. **Buffer reuse** — scoring the same pair twice with the same buffer produces identical results

A 60-second run typically covers 670K+ inputs at ~11,000 exec/s on an x86_64 Linux machine.

See `Fuzz/FuzzyMatchFuzz.swift` for the full fuzz harness and [DAMERAU_LEVENSHTEIN.md](Documentation/DAMERAU_LEVENSHTEIN.md#fuzz-testing) for detailed invariant documentation.

## Unicode Support

FuzzyMatcher operates on raw UTF-8 bytes for performance and supports case-insensitive matching for **ASCII**, **Latin-1 Supplement** (Ä→ä, Ö→ö, Å→å), **Greek** (Α→α, Σ→σ, Ω→ω), and **basic Cyrillic** (А→а, Я→я, Ё→ё).

The primary corpus and use case has been financial instruments (stock tickers, fund names, ISINs), which are predominantly ASCII and Latin-1. Greek and Cyrillic support is provided as a courtesy for users who need these scripts, but they are not a primary target for the package.

Custom byte-level case folding is used instead of Swift's `String.lowercased()` to avoid per-call allocations and iterator overhead in the hot scoring path. An ASCII fast path (checking `String.isASCII` once per candidate) skips all multi-byte dispatch for the vast majority of candidates, keeping throughput at ~33M candidates/sec even with extended script support.

Edit distance and trigrams operate at the byte level. See [DAMERAU_LEVENSHTEIN.md](Documentation/DAMERAU_LEVENSHTEIN.md#unicode-support) for details on what is and isn't supported.

### Normalization

Two kinds of Unicode normalization are performed during matching, allowing queries and candidates to use visually similar characters interchangeably:

- **Diacritic normalization** — Latin-1 diacritics are folded to their ASCII base letters (`café` matches `cafe`, `über` matches `uber`). Combining diacritical marks (U+0300–U+036F) are stripped.
- **Confusable-character normalization** — Visually similar punctuation and whitespace characters are collapsed to their ASCII canonical forms:

| Group | Characters | Canonical |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Apostrophe-like | `'` `'` `` ` `` `´` `ʻ` `ʼ` | `'` U+0027 |
| Double-quote-like | `"` `"` | `"` U+0022 |
| Dash-like | `‐` `‑` `‒` `–` `—` `−` | `-` U+002D |
| Space-like | NBSP | space U+0020 |

This means `Bo's Song` (curly quote) is found by typing `Bo's So` (ASCII apostrophe), `Hawaiʻi` (ʻokina) matches `Hawai'i`, and `well–known` (en-dash) matches `well-known`.

### Limitations

- **No full Unicode normalization (NFC/NFD)** — precomposed characters (e.g., `é` U+00E9) and their decomposed forms (`e` + `◌́` U+0065 U+0301) will still match because basic combining diacritical marks (U+0300–U+036F) are stripped during matching, but full NFC/NFD normalization is not performed
- **CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, and other complex scripts** — matching operates on raw bytes but case folding is not applied; results may be unpredictable
- **Byte-level operations** — trigrams and edit distance count UTF-8 bytes, not grapheme clusters; multi-byte characters cost more edit distance than ASCII

## Matching Modes

FuzzyMatch offers two matching algorithms:

| | Edit Distance (default) | Smith-Waterman |
|---|---|---|
| Philosophy | Penalty-driven (count errors) | Bonus-driven (reward alignments) |
| Typo handling | Native transposition support | No transposition operation |
| Prefix awareness | Explicit prefix scoring | No prefix concept |
| Multi-word queries | Monolithic | Word-by-word AND semantics |
| Throughput | ~33M candidates/sec | ~66M candidates/sec |

The **default edit distance mode** is designed for interactive search where users type imprecisely. It handles transposition typos ("Berkhsire" for Berkshire), progressive typing, and short symbol lookups better than any other matcher tested. **Smith-Waterman mode** excels at multi-word product search, offers ~2x higher throughput, and agrees with nucleo on 92% of top-1 rankings.

```swift
// Default: Edit Distance (recommended for most use cases)
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher()

// Smith-Waterman mode
let matcher = FuzzyMatcher(config: .smithWaterman)
```
