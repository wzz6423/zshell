  caveats <<~EOS
    Zshell requires macOS 15.6 or later.

    Zshell uses a stable self-signed certificate and is not notarized. If macOS
    blocks the first launch, open System Settings > Privacy & Security and choose
    "Open Anyway" after trying to open Zshell. Sparkle verifies subsequent updates.
